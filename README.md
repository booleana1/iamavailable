# I am Available App

This project is developed as part of the **Multiplatform Development** course (Computer Engineering Degree) at IPB - 2024/2025.  
It consists of an application that allows users to signal their availability for specific roles, times, locations, and user groups.

## 📱 About the App

**I am Available** is an availability management tool. A user can declare availability (physical or virtual) and associate it with a role (e.g., teacher, tutor) and a group (e.g., students, mentees).  
Secondary users can check these availabilities, request to join groups, and get notifications.

## 👥 User Roles

- **Main Actor**: The user who declares availability.
- **Secondary Actor**: The user who receives availability info or interacts with the main actor.
- A single user can play both roles.
